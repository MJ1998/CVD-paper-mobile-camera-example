Sensory is an illustrative code intended to accompany an upcoming research 
publication on models trained on mobile-sensor data to evaluate CVD risk.  
The code provides an example of how to collect camera based data (signals) on 
Android devices that would be appropriate for such models. It also provides an 
example functionality for uploading processed images or image sequences to a 
blob-storage that can be owned by a 3P, which is a common need for data 
collection programs.

This is not an official Google product. The code is not intended for use in any

intended for clinical use of any kind, including but not limited to diagnosis or
prognosis. No representations or warranties are made. User or licensee is
